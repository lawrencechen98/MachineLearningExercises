Hi Carey,

I really appreciate you thinking of me and reaching out. The opportunity sounds really interesting, but unfortunately I have recently just accepted another internship opportunity for this summer. However, working at a startup would be a really great experience. I was wondering if your friend's startup is at a point where you could share a name or more information? A contact info would be greatly appreciated, just to potentially reach out in the future?

Also, I've been meaning to ask you recently for some advice. I've become really interested machine learning and artificial intelligence, and have begun learning some algorithms online and I am now an officer for the AI division of ACM UCLA. I was curious to get your opinion on how best to pursue such a field, if you know of any resources or specific niches to point me in a direction. I realize that you may not work directly in that field, but I thought that gaining perspective from someone who has seen so much in the industry could be enlightening. 

Thank you! 

Best, 

Lawrence
