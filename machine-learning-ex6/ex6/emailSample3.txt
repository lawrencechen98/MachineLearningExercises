Dear Lawrence,

Thank you so much for applying to Techfair and showing such enthusiasm for our event. We're very thankful to have received over 1,500 strong applications this year, but unfortunately, that also means that we couldn't accept everyone. 

It's been a hard decision, and after much consideration, I'm sorry to say your application wasn't selected this time around. I want to warmly thank you for applying and I hope you have a great summer. 

All the best,
Julie
