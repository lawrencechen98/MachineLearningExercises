Dear Lawrence,

Thank you for your interest in Autodesk. We have reviewed your resume and would like to discuss with you an internship project opportunity with our team in our San Francisco office. You’d be participating in the development of Quantum, a very exciting new project at Autodesk that is defining the next generation of BIM software! You can find out more about this internship here: https://autodesk.taleo.net/careersection/adsk_cmp/jobdetail.ftl?job=17WD22385. Quantum has received some press coverage recently, including this article in AEC magazine: http://aecmag.com/59-features/1241-autodesk-project-quantum-revit-bim

Please provide some days and times that work best for you and the best number to reach you at. 

Based on my previous interaction with interns, I know interns who spend a summer with us normally a have very fun and meaningful experience at Autodesk! Our Internship Program gives you a head start on your career and an inside look at our company. You’ll gain meaningful, project-based, real-world work experience related to your course of study. The Summer Internship Program also includes executive speaker series, social events and project showcase to our Senior Leadership team.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Carlos and Jim
